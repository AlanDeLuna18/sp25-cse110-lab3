          Overall this meeting went very wrong in <em>every</em> sense of the word. Here were the main talking points: 
          <ul>
              <li>Entire repository has been deleted, no clue who did it or why</li>
              <li>Evidence of the project has been eliminated entirely</li>
          </ul>

          Here are the steps we plan on taking to combat this:
          <ol>
              <li>Remake the repository (<strong>this needs to be done ASAP</strong>), refer to this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories">Github page</a> if you need to review</li>
              <li>Start <i>again</i> from scratch</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
